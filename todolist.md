### Broad Goals
* [Paper on characterization of omega-methods]
* [Paper on omega-methods in large application problems]
* [Anisotropy metrics paper]

***

**Useful links:**
* Caskmodels repo: https://github.com/munkm/caskmodels
* Private caskmodels repo: https://github.com/munkm/caskmodels_private
* Advantg w/ omega methods:  https://code-int.ornl.gov/m15/advantg
* Exnihilo w/ omega methods: https://code-int.ornl.gov/m15/exnihilo

***

### Miscellaneous Tasks
**Rachel**
* Ask Bob and Tom about running on Remus
* Backup running locations other than Remus?
  * Kelly probably has the knowledge to build everything on Savio now
  * Savio might not have the memory available to us that Remus does
* Determine where data for the runs will be uploaded (abacus?) 

**Madicken**
* Document analysis scripts so they're usable for Vanessa and Emily
  * Most likely done in Jupyter notebooks
* Put link to custom advantg and exnihilo repos here, so cloning is
  straightforward
* Upload the exact configurations of the test problems into a branch of
  caskmodels
* Outline the characterization paper in repo.
 * My paper repo? 
* QUESTION: Access to private caskmodels repo? 

**Vanessa & Emily**
* GitHub tutorials on cloning, forking, pull requests
* clone my analysis script repo
* clone caskmodels repo
* try to make a parametric study of one of the example problems in
  `caskmodels/characterization_tests` that includes several quadrature orders
